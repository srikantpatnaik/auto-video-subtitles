This script depends on Python,Mencoder,ffmpeg packages.

The default script adds texts at start & end of the video.

Put this script in a folder containing video files(*.avi).

The default initial time to display the text is 2 to 9 sec.You 
have to manually edit 'srt' to change the default initial time.

The end time is calcualated by the script and the text in the 
second line in the 'srt' is displayed on the video. 

The script can be easily understood & can be modified to
convert multiple videos into different formats by changing command
'mencoder %s -sub 2.srt -o converted_videos/%s -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts vbitrate=1200'

The script can also be modified to support other video formats.For more
details look for 'Mencoder' help.
