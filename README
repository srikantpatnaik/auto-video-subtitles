The default script adds texts at start & end of the video.

Create a folder 'converted_videos' in the same directory.

Edit the 'srt' file for the text you want to display.

have to manually edit 'srt' to change the default initial time.

'mencoder %s -sub 2.srt -o converted_videos/%s -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts vbitrate=1200'
